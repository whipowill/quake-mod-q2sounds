# Q2 Sounds for Quake

This is a folder of replacement sounds for Quake.

I stumbled upon this and thought it was actually pretty good.  I may not continue using it forever, and some of the sounds annoy me so I disable them, but overall I think this mod is worth keeping a copy of.

So far as I can tell, this replaces all the sounds in Quake w/ the sounds from Quake2.  The result brings a totally new feel and crispness to the game, so if you are looking to try something new this might be right up your alley.

The original files as posted by the author were lost until another user posted a link to a Mega account that had his copy of them.  I made this repo to keep this mod safe and secure should anything befall that user's Mega account.
